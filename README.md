# Bonelab Save Manager
Bonelab Save Manager utilises the built in "active_save_game" variable found in the Bonelabs settings.json file to quickly and easily swap between saves

## How to Use
Using BLSM is very simple and hopefully self explanitory. Upon first opening the program, it will look like this

You can add more saves by pressing the "Add Save" button or by pressing "Open Saves Folder" and manually moving the files. They will then appear in the GUI much like this

You can select a save from the list and press "Set Active Save" to set it as the current active save

The "Rename Save" button allows you to rename the selected save file, for easier organisation

And the "Delete Save" button deletes the selected save. Don't worry though as this does come with a confirmation, so no accidental deletions
